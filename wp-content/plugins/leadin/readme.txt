### CRM & Contact Management Platform
Your CRM in the HubSpot WordPress plugin is your company's command center. It's the place where you can track every single customer interaction and get a 360-degree view of your customers. You can even use it to manage or automate marketing, sales, and service processes.

With HubSpot, you don't need to jump from tool to tool to keep track of everything. Instead, you can store all of your data in one place.

HubSpot’s CRM gives you ultimate visibility into customer interactions across every team in your organization. That means that everyone will be on the same page—from marketing to sales to customer service—and able to help your customers more effectively.

Best of all, if you’re planning on growing your business (or you already are), HubSpot has the tools to grow with you.

Features you'll love suited specifically for your business needs:

✅ Lead generation & lead management
✅ Pipeline management
✅ Email marketing
✅ Reporting dashboard
✅ Contact management
✅ Prospect tracking

### [Email Newsletter & Marketing Automation Software](https://www.hubspot.com/products/wordpress/email-marketing)
Would you like to enhance your email marketing campaigns? 🤔

Maybe you'd like to explore different automation features, build professional emails in minutes, and send them to your entire contact database with ease.

Customers love our email marketing software tool for features like:

🤩 **20+ pre-designed email templates to match your campaign goals. (Choose from templates such as newsletters, eBooks, welcome emails, and more!)**

> All you have to do is add your content and press send!

⚒️ **Drag and drop email builder.**

> If you want more options to choose from, HubSpot makes it easy for you. Adjust typography, designs, colors, and more to create campaigns your subscribers will love!

🤖 **Email automation, tracking, and A/B testing.**

> Send emails anytime someone fills out a form or engages with your live chat & chatbots. You can send messages immediately or use email scheduling to send messages later.

Email is one of the most effective ways to stay connected to your audience. With email tracking, all of your emails are logged in your database. You can measure each email’s engagement with reports for open rate and click rate — and use that information to improve campaigns.

### [Forms & Popups](https://www.hubspot.com/products/wordpress/forms)
Want to know the easiest way to learn more about your visitors?

*Ask them directly.*

The problem is that forms can come in so many different shapes and sizes that it's hard to know where to start. That's why HubSpot has options for you.

​​HubSpot's form builder and popup plugin give you the power to create or edit forms in just a few clicks.

First, get familiar with our different form types:

✅ Embedded
✅ Standalone page
✅ Pop-up box
✅ Dropdown banner
✅ Slide in left/right box

Then, when you're ready to go, pick a custom template:

✅ Contact us
✅ Newsletter sign up form template
✅ Support template
✅ eBook download template
✅ Event registration template
✅ More coming soon

Choose from a variety of settings, color schemes, and fonts — or start from scratch. HubSpot comes with an intuitive form and popup builder that simplifies the process, no matter what type of form you have in mind.

Rather stick with your existing forms and popup plugin? That’s fine too! HubSpot integrates with most WordPress form builders, form creators, and popup builders out-of-the-box so you don’t have to worry about a thing.

📈 **Get detailed reports across marketing channels.**

Create detailed reports on performance of various assets, from blog posts and landing pages to email campaigns and more. Arrange these views in dashboards in your plugin, so you can easily see the performance of your website and make data-driven decisions.

### What are people saying about the HubSpot plugin?

> “HubSpot was a big factor in helping us scale WP Buffs to $1M in revenue. Their plugin and sales CRM made our sales process so much more professional and kept us fully organized as we grew from 1 salesperson to 4. Plus, the reporting dashboards allow me to know where our sales game is strong and where we can still improve with just a few clicks. Needless to say, I'm all in on HubSpot.” – **Joe Howard, Founder & CEO, WP Buffs**

> “HubSpot educates marketers beyond just the anonymous web analytics they get from Google Analytics. Instead, it digs down to individual users.” – **Michael Shoup, Founder / CEO, 12South Marketing**

> “HubSpot dramatically cuts down the time I spend on marketing. We used to spend tons of time generating very few inbound leads, but those numbers have gone through the roof with minimal effort.” – **Brian Ruhlmann, Director of Sales & Marketing, AdmitHub**
