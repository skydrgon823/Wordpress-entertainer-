== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Do you support older WordPress versions? =

Version 6.x.x should support WP versions 4.0 and up. Version 4.7.0 should support WP versions 2.3 - 4.0.

Since WordPress is constantly changing, this plugin will always strive to support the latest version of WordPress. As there are many security vulnerabilities reported, please always keep WordPress as up-to-date as possible.

Unfortunately, we do not support older versions of WordPress or the non-current release of this plugin.

= How do I change the WordPress update notification e-mail? =

Go to the General tab in our settings. You can enter a single email address, or multiple if you comma-separate them.

* TWEAK: Bump PHP requirement to 5.6+

* TWEAK: Add WP 5.5 support. Since EUM's update management facilities are much more sophisticated than WP 5.5's new "automatic upgrades" user-interface additions, the new WP 5.5 options do not map simply onto existing EUM options. Thus the only way they can work together is if EUM replaces those additions with links back to the EUM controls.
