== Description ==

= The Best WordPress Popup and Marketing Plugin =

<a href="https://optinmonster.com/wp/?utm_source=orgplugin&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=wpreadme" rel="friend" title="OptinMonster - WordPress Popup and Marketing Plugin">OptinMonster</a> is the ultimate popup builder and marketing plugin that helps you get more email subscribers, increase sales, and grow your business.

With OptinMonster popups and conversion toolkit, you can turn abandoning website visitors into subscribers and customers.

OptinMonster allows you to create beautiful popup forms, email subscription forms, sticky announcement bar (hello bar), gamified spin a wheel opt-in forms, and other types of interactive popups for your site in minutes, not hours!

At OptinMonster, user experience is our #1 priority. This is why unlike typical WordPress popup plugins, OptinMonster comes with smart targeting and personalization features that lets you show the right popup message, to the right user, at the right time.

OptinMonster popups and newsletter opt-in forms are 100% mobile responsive, so your marketing message modals will always look great on all devices (mobile, tablet, laptop, and desktop).

= Drag & Drop Popup Maker =

We were tired of the bloated and slow popup maker plugins. That's why we built OptinMonster to adapt to your marketing workflow and allow you to create custom popups, newsletter opt-in forms, slide-ins popups, announcement bars, and other high converting lead generation forms within minutes.

By using our drag & drop popup maker, you can easily customize the look and feel of your opt-in popups, and even add dynamic popup elements like countdown timers, spin a wheel, etc that change based on user behavior (no code necessary).

But don't just take our word. See what one WordPress expert is saying:

> I was once a disbeliever myself. I didn't like popups at all. But we doubled our email signups, so the results speak for themselves, it just works. OptinMonster makes it super easy and is well worth the money.<br>
> Joost de Valk, Founder of Yoast SEO (<a href="https://optinmonster.com/case-study-how-yoast-doubled-his-email-signups-and-added-10000-email-subscribers-in-a-month/?utm_source=orgplugin&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=wpreadme" rel="friend">See Case Study</a>)

= Pre-built Popup Templates to Boost Conversions =

Building high-converting marketing popups can be time consuming. Why?

Because every other WordPress popup plugin requires you to build popups from scratch. The truth is it's often not necessary to create a popup or shipping bar from scratch unless you really want to.

Whether you're looking to create a newsletter popup, coupon popup, free shipping bar, announcement bar with countdown timer, gamified spin a wheel popup, fullscreen welcome mat popup, slide-in scroll popup, or any other advanced popup modal, we have a popup template for you inside our easy to use popup builder.

OptinMonster comes with hundreds of popup templates to help you save time. See our <a href="https://optinmonster.com/exit-intent-popup-examples/?utm_source=orgplugin&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=wpreadme" rel="friend">exit popup template gallery</a>.

> I have never before seen such effectiveness and efficiency in an optin tool than I have with OptinMonster. In under 2 hours of work, I doubled my daily optin rates thanks to OptinMonster’s incredible options.<br>

= Exit Intent Popups and OnSite Retargeting =

Did you know that over 70% of visitors abandoning your website will never return?

OptinMonster's signature <a href="https://optinmonster.com/features/exit-intent/?utm_source=orgplugin&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=wpreadme" rel="friend">exit-intent popup technology</a> can help you convert abandoning visitors into subscribers and customers.

With exit intent popups, your visitors see a targeted popup message at the precise moment they are about to leave.

Exit popups are proven to convert an additional 2 - 4% of your visitors into email subscribers and paying customers.

You can use exit intent popups combined with <a href="https://optinmonster.com/features/onsite-retargeting/?utm_source=orgplugin&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=wpreadme" rel="friend">OnSite retargeting</a> to show different popup messages to new visitors vs returning visitors.

These advanced popup triggers are highly effective in growing your email list, reducing WooCommerce cart abandonment, and saving you moeny on PPC advertising and retargeting ads.

> In only 7 months, we added more than 95,000 names to our email list using OptinMonster's Exit Intent™ technology. We strongly recommend it!<br>
> Michael Stelzner, Founder of Social Media Examiner (<a href="https://optinmonster.com/how-social-media-examiner-250000-subscribers-using-optinmonster-split-testing/?utm_source=orgplugin&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=wpreadme" rel="friend">See Case Study</a>)

= Smart Page Targeting and Behavior Based Personalization =

All OptinMonster popups comes with advanced page targeting and behavior based personalization.

This means you can show a custom popup for specific page or section of your site, show a custom popup based on users' geolocation, show a custom popup when users click a specific link, and more.

You can even show unique popups based on user's past behavior such as: have they clicked on an existing marketing popup, seen another popup campaign, closed a marketing popup, viewed X number of pages, etc.

These personalization features of OptinMonster popups make them highly effective in improving your lead generation, increasing subscribers, and growing sales.

> Using OptinMonster, I was able to increase sales $55,000 after capturing nearly 7% more leads with a single optin!<br>
> Cole Joseph, Owner of Cole's Classroom (<a href="https://optinmonster.com/coles-classroom-added-55494-sales?utm_source=orgplugin&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=wpreadme" rel="friend">See Case Study</a>)


= Popup A/B Testing, Email Marketing Integration, and Popup Analytics =

Unlike other WordPress popup plugins, OptinMonster popups come with reliable A/B split testing and accurate popup analytics without slowing down your site.

Typical WordPress popup plugins use wp-ajax to setup popup analytics. This slows down your site and also results in unreliable popup analytics due to cache plugin settings.

Similarly, A/B testing in a basic WordPress popup plugin is broken because caching plugins can skew the data.

We fixed both these issues with our superior popup infrastructure, so you can have reliable A/B testing for popups, accurate popup conversion analytics, and seamless email marketing / CRM integrations for your popups (bonus: popup lead storage & lead backup for popup is now included too).

> Since we started using OptinMonster our email list conversion rate increased by 300% and our sales by 20%. The best investment you can make for your online business!<br>
> Alex Chris, Digital Marketing Manager (<a href="https://optinmonster.com/case-study-how-reliablesoft-net-increased-conversions-by-300-using-optinmonster/?utm_source=orgplugin&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=wpreadme" rel="friend">See Case Study</a>)
